- Restore an old configuration and downgrade Ganeti

You can restore an old configuration from a backup file and downgrade Ganeti.

```
# on all nodes
systemctl stop ganeti-kvmd.service
systemctl stop ganeti.target
mv /var/lib/ganeti /var/lib/ganeti.failed
tar zxf /root/ganeti-BACKUP_DATE.tar.gz -C /var/lib

yum downgrade ganeti-2.x.y-z.el7

systemctl start ganeti.target
systemctl start ganeti-kvmd.service
```

### Updated X.509 certificate signing algorithm by [Ganeti 2.16.1 Release](https://github.com/ganeti/ganeti/releases/tag/v2.16.1)

Ganeti now uses the SHA-256 digest algorithm to sign all generated X.509 certificates used to secure the RPC communications between nodes. Previously, Ganeti was using SHA-1 which is seen as weak (but not broken) and has been deprecated by most vendors; most notably, OpenSSL — used by Ganeti on some setups — rejects SHA-1-signed certificates when configured to run on security level 2 and above.

Users are advised to re-generate Ganeti's server and node certificates after installing 2.16.1 on all nodes using the following command:

```
# --new-cluster-certificate option includes --new-node-certificates option.
gnt-cluster renew-crypto --new-cluster-certificate

# check new certificates
openssl x509 -in /var/lib/ganeti/server.pem -noout -text
openssl x509 -in /var/lib/ganeti/client.pem -noout -text
```

On setups using RAPI and/or SPICE with Ganeti-generated certificates, it should also re-generate them using the following command:

```
gnt-cluster renew-crypto --new-rapi-certificate --new-spice-certificate
```
